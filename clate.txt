Halion wrestled against the restraints which bound him, but the effort proved a vanity. He cried out through his gag, but none came to free him. He heard footsteps on the deck above, yet none which came to meet him. Soon, his struggling subsided, and Halion was left only with the weight of his own body tied against the bulkhead and the quiet, horrible plague of his own mind as a prisoner of himself. 
	Damn them. Damn them all.
	One of the shipmates descended, a young lad by the name of Daerun, and fetched a skin of cider, sparing not a glance for Halion as he tried to call out to the boy, and returned to the top deck as quickly as he arrived. Halion found himself unable to resent him. They were Anymities' men, all. It was Anymities who allowed this mutiny to proceed. Mutiny. Could such a word even be used to describe his betrayal? He did not captain the Vanytisys. He barely knew their crew. They owed him no loyalty. No. Treason. Anymities had sworn himself to Halion's service, not these men. The Magai had sworn himself to Halion, though he claimed otherwise. 
	Halion remembered that night as vividly as one could. Dead men scattered across the floor, the dark robed man's sword soaked in their blood. 
	"I serve Dane," he had said in barely decipherable Shentz, bent on one knee, head bowed, breathing heavy. Now, that man who once freed him of his bonds had returned Halion unto them.
	They had ridden south on horseback for days at breakneck pace, boarded the Vanytisys at its dock in Penhyla, and set sail for the Seawalt. Halion had thought he would have more time there when they returned, but as quickly as he had arrived, they left once more. His mother had seen to that. 
	Halion soon gave up any hope of being set free, so his mind continued looking back. He thought of Aphlora and Penhyla, its capital. Penhyla, a city like no other. Penhyla, jewel of the Ebyn, Penhyla, seat of the Elohaim, Penhyla, rotten swamp within swamp. 
	That autumn visit had been his first time to the city. His half brother Bleyk and a handful of his father's courtiers had journeyed to the summer's summit from Maphlamar. Halion had represented the Dane Line, joined by his sister, Erynalda. As for the Price Line, the Governor had sent his heir to lead the delegation. How long ago that all seemed, now. At that summit of heirs, the arrangements had been made for the union of the Lines Dane and Price. Would that those arrangements may be honored, Halion thought, despite my mistakes. 
	He remembered how old his grandfather of Audsen had looked, how tired he had seemed. Age did not favor the man, though he had lived long. Halion wondered if he would live long enough to see the cruelty in age as had the Elohaim. Perhaps this voyage's wrath may instead be a mercy. His sister had looked finer than any jewel. Though no Audsen, she had seemed an emblem of all the majesty to which their Line claimed right. Blue eyed, fair of skin, more comely than any of her blue blooded relatives, sharper than a sword-- Erynalda seemed molded by the gods for the station she now claimed in their grandfather's court. "A Khaskylil without equal," the man had named her one night with his shallow voice and slow words. "You women of Dane always make such fine Khaskylil." 
	Halion's uncle had bellowed a laugh in response to his father's failure of memory, "Father! Father! Oh my, do you forget yourself! The girl is no witch." 'Big' Brent's cheeks had been flushed with wine, and his manners forgotten in drunken jolly. Any other would have let the lapse go unspoken, but not he, and not that night. "Father, must we put you to bed already
